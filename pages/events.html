                            “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life
                            to
                            everything.” – Plato
                            Music is a blessing. It’s something that everybody enjoys, and anyone can feel. It’s the way
                            the
                            soul of the artist expresses itself into this dimension if it can’t be done through words.

                            ”Books made into movies”
                            The book is a film that takes place in the mind of the reader. That's why we go to movies
                            and
                            say, "Oh, the book is better"
                            Have you read any books that have been made into films?
                            Which version did you prefer, the book or the film?

                            ”Media Literacy”
                            This week we are going to find out how to develop skills and habbits of media literacy.
                            These skills include being able to access media on a basic level, to analize it in a
                            critical way based on certain key concepts, to evaluate it hinged on that analisis, and,
                            finally, to produce media oneself. This process of learning media literacy skills is
                            media education.

                            The height of a person's existence lies not in his/her ability to merely survive, but in
                            discovering what to live for. Having a well-defined goal in life is crucial to understanding
                            the direction of our career and pursuing these goals
